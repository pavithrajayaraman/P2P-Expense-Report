**About**

The P2P-Expense-Report project streamlines how peer‑to‑peer expenses are captured, validated, and analyzed. It takes raw transaction data (such as user-to-user payments, reimbursements, and shared bills) and turns it into a clean, structured expense report with clear categorizations, summaries, and basic analytics. The goal is to make it easy for teams or individuals to track who paid whom, for what, and when, while providing quick insights into total spend, frequent counterparties, and spending patterns over time. 
This repository is useful if you need a lightweight, data-driven way to understand and report on P2P financial activity.
